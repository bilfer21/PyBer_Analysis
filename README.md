# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate PyBer fare revenue by city type. For the purposes of the analysis, city types were identified as urban, suburban, and rural. Weekly ride and fare data from the period January 1, 2019 through April 29,2019 was utilized for the analysis.


## Results

The results indicate that the majority of PyBer fare revenue comes from rides associated with urban cities. Evaluating fare revenue from urban cities shows an average weekly revenue of $2,180. Revenue from suburban cities averages $1,052 per week and revenue from rural cities averages $230 per week. 

Chart of Weekly Revenue by City Type

when looking at total revenue over the January 1 - April 29 period, fares from urban cities represented 63% of total revenue, while revenue from suburban cities and rural cities represented 30% and 7% of total revenue, respectively.

A deeper look into the data reveals that urban cities have many more drivers than the suburban and rural cities. The data shows 2,405 drivers in urban citites, while suburban cities have 490 drivers and rural cities have 78 drivers. Fares per ride also differ across the city types, with urban fares averaging $24.53 per ride, suburban fares averaging $30.97 per ride, and rural fares averaging $34.62 per ride. This difference in average fare per ride could be explained by the shorter distances typically covered in suburban cities versus suburban and rural cities.


## Summary

When looking at the results, it is obvious that fares from rides in urban cities contribute a great deal to overall PyBer revenue. However, when looking at driver counts across the respective city types, it is also apparent that there are many more drivers located in the urban cities. It is not known if the lower driver counts seen in rural cities are affecting the revenue, specifically. if there is demand that is not being met in the rural cities because of the lower driver count, this may represent an opportunity for increased revenue with the hiring of additional drivers, especially with average fares per ride being considerably higher in the rural cities. It may be advisable to gather data on ride demand that is not being met (ride requests rejected), so that driver counts can be adjusted for the different city types to optimize revenue.
